# Sunoo User Guide
Sunoo is a chatbot that helps to **manage tasks**!

Use the `help` command to view the list of commands available for use:
```java
Commands should start with the keyword; to check aliases, type "alias"!

1. List all commands: list
2. Delete a command: delete TASK_INDEX (e.g., delete 2 deletes the second task in the list)
3. Mark a command: mark TASK_INDEX (e.g., mark 1 marks the first task as done)
4. Unmark a command: unmark TASK_INDEX (e.g., unmark 1 marks the first task as not done)
5. Add a todo task: todo TASK_DESCRIPTION (e.g., todo Buy groceries)
6. Add a deadline task: deadline TASK_DESCRIPTION /by yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm
   (e.g., deadline Submit report /by 2025-09-20 23:59)
7. Add an event task: event TASK_DESCRIPTION /from yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm /to yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm
   (e.g., event Team meeting /from 2025-09-21 14:00 /to 2025-09-21 16:00)
8. Find tasks containing a keyword: find KEYWORD
9. Exit the program: bye
10. For a surprise: enhypen TITLE_TRACK
```
